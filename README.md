## Compatibility

The Minetest Game github master HEAD is generally compatible with the github
master HEAD of the Minetest engine.  
Additionally, when the Minetest engine is tagged to be a certain version (eg.
0.4.10), Minetest Game is tagged with the version too.

When stable releases are made, Minetest Game is packaged and made available in
	https://minetest.net/downloads/
and in case the repository has grown too much, it may be reset. In that sense,
this is not a "real" git repository (Package maintainers please note).
