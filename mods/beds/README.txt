Minetest Game mod: beds
=======================

Adds beds to Minetest which allow to skip the night.

Rightclick to sleep:
- singleplayer: night is skipped and spawnpoint is set to bed position
- multiplayer:  if more than 50% of online players are lying in bed nightskip can be forced,
	or night is skipped when all are sleeping

To disable respawning at bed add "enable_bed_respawn = false" to minetest.conf
