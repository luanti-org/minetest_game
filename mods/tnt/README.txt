Minetest Game mod: tnt
======================

Adds TNT blocks and gunpowder.
Gunpowder can be used to craft TNT or as fuze for TNT.

There are different ways to blow up TNT:
  1. Hit it with a torch.
  2. Hit a gunpowder fuze that leads to a TNT block with a torch.
  3. Activate it with mesecons (not included in Minetest Game)
TNT has a damage radius of 7 blocks.

By default TNT is disabled in multiplayer. Add "enable_tnt = true" to minetest.conf to enable it.
